        The player is a newly enrolled student in the Peggle Institute, where they will learn the art of Peggling and put their skills to test through stunning levels and breathtaking challenges. But they're not alone in the adventure — headmaster Bjorn and other whimsical teachers — will assist the player with their magical powers!

     <p>
        In each level of Peggle, the player is tasked with clearing a board filled with approximately one hundred pegs, arranged to match the level’s background design. The board is enclosed by three walls on the top and sides, with the bottom left open. Some levels also feature fixed and moving elements that add to the challenge.
